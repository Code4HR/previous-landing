Landing page for BetaNYC.us

Note that branch `gh-pages` is what shows on production BetaNYC.org. Master does nothing.

#How to Code for this Repo
Option A: Fork, Edit, then Pull Request when ready.

Option B: If in the BetaNYC brigade and you have write access to repo: Develop/test in your own branch, preferably a feature-named-branch, and once it's ready for production, merge into gh-pages, which auto deploys to GitHub pages for BetaNYC.org

Also, it's nice if you merge/commit to gh-pages, then [let the team know in the discussion group](http://www.meetup.com/betanyc/messages/archive/).
